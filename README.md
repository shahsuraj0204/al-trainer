## 📌 Features

- 🧍‍♂️ Pose detection using computer vision (e.g., Mediapipe / OpenPose)
- 📷 Real-time webcam support
- ✅ Feedback on correct/incorrect posture
- 🧠 Trained ML models for pose classification
- 📈 Accuracy scoring for each pose
- 📹 Optional recording/playback for reviewing sessions

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- OpenCV 🎥
- MediaPipe / TensorFlow / PyTorch 🧠
- Streamlit or Tkinter (for UI) 🖥️

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-yoga-trainer.git
cd ai-yoga-trainer
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Application
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Or, if using Streamlit:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
📂 Project Structure
bash

🧠 How It Works
Captures webcam video

Detects body keypoints using pose detection models

Compares keypoints with reference poses

Gives real-time feedback (alignment, posture, accuracy score)

🤖 Future Improvements
Add voice guidance for yoga sessions

Support for dynamic flows (like Sun Salutation)

Integration with wearables (e.g., fitness bands)

Personalized training plans
